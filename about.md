# Vina is a PhD candidate at the Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of South Australia. Her research focuses on the brain mechanisms underlying naturalistic language processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis.

This blog is intended to share her PhD learnings, particularly in the area of neuroimaging analysis, and to demonstrate how R can be used to facilitate the use of AFNI (an fMRI analysis software).

Additionally, in this blog, Vina shares her thoughts and synthesis of neuroscientific research on neurodivergent individuals, particularly those diagnosed with ADHD and/or autism. Vina is especially passionate about the different communication styles of these individuals and how neurolinguistic research and tools can shed light on, and help bridge, the gaps between diverse thinking and processing styles.
